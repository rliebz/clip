Package clip is a high opinionated, highly unstable library for building
command-line applications.

Warning: Clip is current incomplete software and should not yet be used by
anyone.

# Quick Start

To get an app running requires no special configuration and does not prescribe
any directory structure. For an app named `my-app`:

	package main

	import (
		"log"
		"os"

		"github.com/rliebz/clip/arg"
		"github.com/rliebz/clip/flag"
		"github.com/rliebz/clip/command"
	)

	func main() {
		// Create a command-line application
		app := command.New("my-app")

		// Run it
		os.Exit(app.Run())
	}

By default, commands with no action specified print the help documentation:

	$ my-app
	my-app

	Options:
	  -h, --help  Print help and exit

Since this app doesn't do anything, the help documentation isn't very useful.
Commands can be configured by passing a list of functional options, such as
command.WithSummary for a one-line summary, or command.WithDescription for a
slightly longer description:

	app := command.New(
		"my-app",
		command.WithSummary("A command-line application"),
		command.WithDescription(`This is a simple "Hello World" demo application`),
	)

	os.Exit(app.Run())

Now when running my-app:

	$ my-app
	my-app - A command-line application

	This is a simple "Hello World" demo application

	Options:
	  -h, --help  Print help and exit

Let's add a sub-command using command.WithCommand and functionality using
command.WithAction. Because commands are immutable once created, we must
declare sub-commands before their parent commands:

	// Define a sub-command "hello"
	hello := command.NEw(
		"hello",
		command.WithSummary("Greet the world"),
		command.WithAction(func(Ctx *command.Context) error {
			fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
			return nil
		}),
	)

	// Create the root command "my-app"
	app := command.New(
		"my-app",
		command.WithSummary("A command-line application"),
		command.WithDescription(`This is a simple "Hello World" demo application.`),
		command.WithCommand(hello),
	)

	// Run and exit with the appropriate status code
	os.Exit(app.Run())

Sub-commands also appear in the help documentation:

	$ my-app
	my-app - A command-line application

	This is a simple "Hello World" demo application.

	Commands:
	  hello  Greet the world

	Options:
	  -h, --help  Print help and exit

	$ my-app hello --help
	my-app hello - Greet the world

	Options:
	  -h, --help  Print help and exit

And the command can be run:

	$ my-app hello
	Hello, world!
